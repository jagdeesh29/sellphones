My company will be an early mover as we’re starting a very unique venture to sell 2nd hand cell phones efficiently. We are using unique techniques which is still not used in this business by any of the companies at the moment. As nobody has thought about this before we could earn huge profits and the other rival companies would have to play catch up in this race. We’ll be having a monopoly in selling 2nd hand-sell phones. If some other company comes up with unique techniques like prediction of the products and giving added warranty then we will be in a huge loss as the whole venture is dependent on the uniqueness. We’ll also become a respectable and renowned company if we get in early. Being unique also allows us to get the help of the stakeholders that we need which otherwise would be difficult to get if someone else starts such a venture before us. For all these reasons we need to be an early mover in this market.
