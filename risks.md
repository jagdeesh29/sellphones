Our venture has risks associated with team, technology, finance, and market. The venture is very
 much dependent on the senior developers who’ll be helping to build the website efficiently. These
 guys also need to learn about algorithms on how to collect data related to mobile phones. These
 data prediction algorithms are the roots of our site as the priority of our site is to give accurate
 estimations for mobile phones. This is the main idea that’ll attract people to visit our website. And
 also if our site crashes or there is some kind of issue with it, they are the ones who’ll be looking into
 it. These guys know in and out procedures of our company and the main idea behind our company
 as well as the logic used for running such a website. If these guys leave, it will be a huge risk as the
 whole venture is dependent on the capabilities of these guys. To mitigate this type of risk we’ll be
 recruiting capable individuals who have good knowledge regarding the subject. We’ll be asking the
 existing team who are willing to leave the company to give a knowledge transfer to the ones who’ll
 be joining our team so that everybody in the company is in sync. We’ll also offer a raise in their
 salaries before allowing them to leave depending on their performance. The other thing is we’ll hear
 what the guys who want to leave have to say, and then decide if anything can be done regarding
 that to make them stay.
 There is financial risk associated with our venture because our investment for the service centers
 solely depends on our stakeholders. This is a major part of the venture as verifying the cell phones
 before actually putting their ads on the website is mandatory. Without the service centers
 functioning correctly we cannot verify the phones thoroughly to identify the defects. This one
 additional feature is not seen in any of the websites to help sell cell phones. This is a huge risk if not
 taken care of appropriately. We need financial gateways to complete the transaction without which
 our site won't be able to earn profit. This profit is our cycle. With this profit, we’ll be able to pay the
 stakeholders back. These stakeholders will have our back only if there is profit. So financial gateways
 like Paypal is huge for our venture. To mitigate these types of risks we’ll be earning huge profits so
 that our stakeholders would not have any complaints against us. We’ll also be showing them graphs
 regarding our development and what it will look like infrequent intervals so that they’ll be assured.
 Seeing our company gain profits the stakeholders won't pull back from sponsoring us for the service
 centers as these service centers will get profits from our customers through the phone verification
 process. We’ll also buy insurance for our venture so that we’ll be covered if any uncertain risks
 occur.
 Thirdly, there is market risk too. Competitors like OLX, eBay can catch up and make changes to their
 existing features. These websites are already huge but don’t have some of the crucial features that
 we’re providing. If these companies can give those features then they’ll be a very dangerous
 competitor to compete with. These companies are already well funded and have established their
 brand name. It will be very difficult to compete with these companies if they have all the features
 that we are giving. To mitigate these types of risks we’ll be adding many new features in the near
 future that our competitor is not offering. These features will add up to the existing features to
 make our product more creative and unique. As we already have a step ahead than our competitors
 it will be difficult for them to play catch up. We’ll also lower the costs of our services.
 Lastly, our site also faces some technology risks. As Android and iOS are the two major platforms for
 having apps in the field of mobile phones, we’ll be making our app on android and iOS to target
 more audience and also to make it easily accessible from anywhere. For this we should have experts
 who know these technologies well. To mitigate this, we’ll be replacing these experts with new
 experts who can deliver with quality. We’ll also give shares to these employees so that they won't
 leave the company.
 These are some of the major risks that are seen in my venture and the ways to mitigate them
 efficiently.
