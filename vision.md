As our venture deals with selling 2nd hand cell phones, it mainly targets the age group between 15 to 45 as this is the range that uses cell phones the most. We’ll be mainly using social networking apps like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram to reach out to my customers and I’ll also use some advertising campaigns to get more customers on board. The uniqueness in my venture should be good enough to secure the customers to get them started to use my application. The uniqueness includes estimating the price of the cell phones without user having to worry about it. These customers will be served well by the service we’ll be providing such as free pickups for the cell phones that the customers are trying to sell. Good management of the website and well-written ads that are posted on the website. To retain these customers, we’ll keep on adding new features to our website/application so that they do not need to worry about selling their products. One of the features includes giving warranty from our side to the customers who’re buying the cell phones at a cheaper rate. We’ll also give them coupons to give them special discounts on the phones that are being sold. To sell our product we’ll be using advertising campaigns and social media. We’ll also improve SEO (Search Engine Optimization) so that our site shows up on the first page on google search. We’ll develop customer relationships by giving good customer service. We’ll also give coupons so that the customers are pleased. We will also ask for feedback and work on the negative ones so as to keep the customers happy
