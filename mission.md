To become the world’s leading company to help sell second-hand phones efficiently. In the long term, my company will be helping to sell second-hand phones at the best price available. Many people get fooled while purchasing second-hand cell phones. The buyers don’t even know if the phone has a defect or not. This venture solves all those issues. It will be a platform to sell your phones one to one. This venture will become one single hub to sell his/her second-hand cell phones without needing to go anywhere, making selling of phones effortless. The buyers will be getting an additional warranty for the mobile they’ve purchased depending on the condition which is an additional bonus. This assures the buyer to buy the cell phones they’ve been looking for without having a second thought. Our company removes the middleman which is an added advantage in saving money. The users need not care to price their phones as the company will be doing it for them. We’ll be using algorithms to predict the price of used cell phones and collect data about the existing cell phones. In the coming future, there will be additional features that will enhance user experience, save more money and help users connect and sell phones more efficiently.
